# ChatDB-JavaScript
Web version of ChatDB completely run on the browser. 
<br>
The main goal of this project is to query any database using natural langauge. <br>
The difference is, it is completely run in the browser and not on any server.<br>
This allows privacy of the DB owners, as no one person/team has access to the DB apart from the DB owner. 
<br><br>
Steps to use this notebook on the browser for now:
1. Download the notebook.
2. Open xeus-jupyterlite (https://jupyter-xeus.github.io/xeus-javascript/lab/index.html).
   <br>This is a JavaScript kernel for JupyterLite, powered by Xeus
4. Upload the file to it and run the cells.
5. Modify the first cell to update the query.
